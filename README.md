# Python Data Types
# 1.Introduction to DataTypes
The data type defines which operations can safely be performed to create, transform and use the variable in another computation. In most programming languages, variable values commonly possess a static type.

# 2.Python Strings
String is a collection of alphabets, words or other characters. It is one of the primitive data structures and are the building blocks for data manipulation. Python has a built-in string class named str .

# 3.Python List (all list methods)
append() ,
extend() ,
insert(),
remove() ,
pop() ,
clear(),
index() ,
count(),
copy(),
reverse(),
sort(),

# 4.Python Tuples
In Python, a tuple is a built-in data type that allows you to create immutable sequences of values. The values or items in a tuple can be of any type. 


# Python Operators
# 1.Basic operator in python
The four basic operations in mathematics are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

# 2.Logical and bitwise not operator on boolean
In Python, the logical not operator is used to negate a boolean expression while the bitwise not operator is used to invert the bits in a number.

# 3.Ternary operator
The ternary operator in Python is simply a shorter way of writing an if and if...else statements. 

# 4.Division operator in python
The division operator produces the quotient of its operands where the left operand is the dividend and the right operand is the divisor.

# 5.Operator Overloading in Python
 Operator Overloading means giving extended meaning beyond their predefined operational meaning. For example operator + is used to add two integers as well as join two strings and merge two lists. It is achievable because '+' operator is overloaded by int class and str class.

# 6.Any & all in python
Python also has a built-in all function that returns True if all items are truthy. The any and all functions are two sides of the same coin: any returns True as soon as it finds a match. all returns False as soon as it finds a non-match.

# 7.Inplace and standard operators in python
 In-place operation is an operation that changes directly the content of a given linear algebra, vector, matrices(Tensor) without making a copy. The operators which helps to do the operation is called in-place operator.

# 8.Operator function in python Set â€“ 1
Operators are the symbols or special characters used to perform operations on operands. In Python, operators can be used to perform arithmetic, logical, and comparison operations. Some examples of operator functions in Python are '+' for addition, '-' for subtraction, '*' for multiplication, and '/' for division.

# 9.Inplace operator Set -1
An in-place operation is an operation that changes directly the content of a given Tensor without making a copy. Inplace operations in pytorch are always postfixed with a _ , like . add_() or . scatter_() . Python operations like += or *= are also inplace operations.

# 10.Logic Gates in Python
Logic gates are the most basic materials to implement digital components. These gates deal with binary values, either 0 or 1. Different types of gates take different numbers of input, but all of them provide a single output.

# 11.Python | a += b is not always a = a + b
The statement a += b modifies the existing list bound to a . Since it does not change the object identity, the changes are visible to all bindings to the object represented by a . The operator += is obviously not symmetrical, it is equivalent to list. extend , which iterates over the second operand.

# 12.Difference between == and is operator in Python
The == operator compares the value or equality of two objects, whereas the Python is operator checks whether two variables point to the same object in memory.

# 13.Python Membership and Identity Operators | in, not in, is, is not
The identity operators 'is' and 'is not' are used to check whether two variables refer to the same object or not. The membership operators 'in' and 'not in' are used to test whether a value is a member of a sequence or collection. The difference between these two types of operators is in their functionality.
